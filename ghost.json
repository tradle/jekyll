But before I do that, I want to give a short overview of what TIM does, and what one might use it for. But before that…a short joke to incept clarity:\n\n> Two deaf French guys, Pierre and Jean-Paul, are talking:  \n> **Pierre**: want to go fishing with me tomorrow?  \n> **Jean-Paul**: can’t, I’m busy, I’m going fishing tomorrow\n\n\n## Trust in motion\n\nTIM is a peer to peer comm device with two modes:\n\n### Walky talky\n\nThis is serverless, end-to-end encrypted (OTR*), realtime, NAT-breaking, free chat, much like secure IM. It allows you to talk “securely” peer to peer, without any intermediaries. If you’re thinking “what intermediaries?”, think about any communication method you use today.\n\nWhen you call someone on the phone, your call goes through your telco. When you email someone, the email goes through your email provider. When you use your debit card, your payment goes through a number of intermediaries like PayPal, Visa/Mastercard and your bank. When you chat with someone on most IM clients, your messages go through some server or another, owned by some third party or another. When you sext over Snapchat, the Snapchat servers see your naked butt before they pass it along to its final delighted recipient.\n\nEssentially, we live in a world where there’s a man in middle for everything.\n\nSo if you don’t make sex tapes, or you keep them on VHS, what’s so bad about having an intermediary? Just that they own your ass. Being in control of the comm channel, they can deny you service, surveil you, impersonate you, change what you say and sell you out to other third parties, to name a few. I’m not saying that they do that (some of them do), but they can. Which means you’re putting a lot of trust into them.\n\nNow that you’re very scared, as you damn well should be, I should say that at least among chat clients, there are a number that provide good security. If you’re interested, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) keeps an updated breakdown [here](https://www.eff.org/secure-messaging-scorecard). You’ll notice that AIM, Skype, WhatsApp and Facebook chat fail miserably. Among the champions there’s Pidgin, which has been around forever, and WhisperSystems’ privacy-empowering duo of Signal and TextSecure.\n\nIf you haven’t already, have a look at the security factors EFF uses to score messengers. Just the questions they ask are a small lesson in security:\n\n- Encrypted in transit?\n- Encrypted so the provider can’t read it?\n- Can you verify contacts’ identities?\n- Are past comms secure if your keys are stolen?\n- Is the code open to independent review?\n- Is security design properly documented?\n- Has there been any recent code audit?\n\nAt it’s current state of evolution, TIM will not be able to address all of these questions to the EFF’s satisfaction. But this list outlines some clear goals.\n\n### Chained messages / “Quotable chat”**\n\nServerless, encrypted (ECC, AES), slow (1+ hours for delivery), relatively expensive chat (2p / message). This is arguably the more important part of TIM’s functionality. It is not meant for regular messages, but rather messages you want to be highly auditable, messages you want to be able to make provable claims about in the future:\n\n- Claim & prove the message existed at a certain time\n- Claim & prove the message’s contents haven’t changed\n- Claim & prove who sent the message and to whom it was sent\n\nThere are also several special properties to the message’s existence:\n\n- It’s stored/served by conversation participants (vs in the cloud). There’s a balance between centralization and decentralization. On the one hand messages are all hanging off the blockchain (though not stored directly in it), and on the other the blockchain is a decentralized database, unlike the typical cloud database.\n- It’s encrypted to be readable only by conversation participants. Moreover, each message is encrypted with different keys***.\n\n### With their powers combined…\n\nThe two comm modes, transient vs permanent, realtime vs don’t-hold-your-breath, deniable vs non-repudiable, work together hand in hand. When you engage in small talk, use the first one. When the message is a contract or a payment or any kind of transaction for which accountability is important, use the second (but still use the first for realtime delivery).\n\n### What’s the point?\n\nThe idea that led to TIM’s birth is not new. The goal was and is to enable a decentralized identity, and to allow network participants to communicate and build their reputations, without those communications and reputations belonging to a third party. This “identity platform” can then be used for e-commerce, governance, etc.\n\n### KYC: statements of trust\n\n[![XKCD: Responsible behavior](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/responsible_behavior.png \"Statements of trust\")](https://xkcd.com/364)\n\nThe specific application we’re working on currently is KYC: statements of trust by parties with great motivation to get their facts right (banks), about parties who need reputations in order to garner trust in the global marketplace (individuals and SMEs). Using Tradle’s TIM, when banks verify companies and individuals, they then reward those individuals at the end of the KYC process by publishing statements of trust about them. Those statements, as well as the raw data consumed by the KYC process, can then be shared by the individual in global marketplace, e.g. with other banks and network operators, in the on-demand marketplace, etc.\n\nWith that in mind, the first step towards this goal is creating and publishing an identity to hang data and statements of trust on. The tutorial for doing this will appear in the next installment.\n\n<sub>* OTR (off-the-record) provides the interesting duality of ensuring that you’re mutually authenticated with the other party, while providing deniability of the conversation. In other words, you know you’re talking to them, but you can’t prove they said anything to a third party.</sub><sub>** “Quotable chat” in quotes, pun very much intended.</sub><sub>*** The current design does not provide what’s called “perfect forward secrecy,” as keys used to encrypt links embedded in the blockchain are reused. This is a weakness in the design that we would love some help designing out.</sub>\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>I want to give a short tutorial on how to use Tradle’s trust-in-motion (<a href=\"https://github.com/tradle/tim\">TIM</a>) open source software.

When you engage in small talk, use the first one.

The goal was and is to enable a decentralized identity, and to allow network participants to communicate and build their reputations, without those communications and reputations belonging to a third party. This “identity platform” can then be used for e-commerce, governance, etc.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kycstatementsoftrust\">KYC: statements of trust</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://xkcd.com/364\"><img src=\"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/responsible_behavior.png\" alt=\"XKCD: Responsible behavior\" title=\"Statements of trust\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The specific application we’re working on currently is KYC: statements of trust by parties with great motivation to get their facts right (banks), about parties who need reputations in order to garner trust in the global marketplace (individuals and SMEs). Using Tradle’s TIM, when banks verify companies and individuals, they then reward those individuals at the end of the KYC process by publishing statements of trust about them. Those statements, as well as the raw data consumed by the KYC process, can then be shared by the individual in global marketplace, e.g. with other banks and network operators, in the on-demand marketplace, etc.</p>\n\n<p>With that in mind, the first step towards this goal is creating and publishing an identity to hang data and statements of trust on. The tutorial for doing this will appear in the next installment.</p>\n\n<p><sub>* OTR (off-the-record) provides the interesting duality of ensuring that you’re mutually authenticated with the other party, while providing deniability of the conversation. In other words, you know you’re talking to them, but you can’t prove they said anything to a third party.</sub><sub><em>* “Quotable chat” in quotes, pun very much intended.</sub><sub></em>** The current design does not provide what’s called “perfect forward secrecy,” as keys used to encrypt links embedded in the blockchain are reused. This is a weakness in the design that we would love some help designing out.</sub></p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2015-09-14 10:51:27","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2016-08-25 15:28:08","updated_by":7,"published_at":"Invalid date","published_by":1},{"id":8,"uuid":"8b5d5dd5-c507-48ed-9bf4-beaec9293efa","title":"My first week at Tradle","slug":"my-first-week-at-tradle","markdown":"\nA week ago, I turned up at a recruiting event at Startupbootcamp London Fintech filled with anticipation.

A quick recap on what that means.\n\nToday, banks are either doing KYC alone, or through an intermediary. Neither works well.\n\nIf they’re doing it alone, they do a lot more work and each bank repeats the work.\n\nIf they use an intermediary, (e.g. a KYC registry) there are other problems. For the intermediary, they are stuck between two opposing and increasingly strict sets of regulations: financial crime and data privacy laws.\n\nAlso, centralization makes them vulnerable to cyber attacks.\n\nFor the banks, it’s the liability for non-compliance when the intermediary messes up. And there’s another problem: KYC registries are in the business of monetizing your data. And they take power away from their customers: the banks.\n\nGoogle’s slogan is “don’t be evil”, but their business model is increasingly incompatible with it. At the very least because all governments are incentivized to pressure them into giving them data. In banking, everyone knows Experian is a necessary evil.\n\nWe’re offering an alternative.\n\nTradle’s KYC network allows banks to share data with the help of the blockchain. The blockchain (while not sharing the data), makes the KYC process highly auditable. This makes compliance officers and regulators happy.

A quick recap on what that means.</p>\n\n<p>Today, banks are either doing KYC alone, or through an intermediary. Neither works well.</p>\n\n<p>If they’re doing it alone, they do a lot more work and each bank repeats the work.</p>\n\n<p>If they use an intermediary, (e.g. a KYC registry) there are other problems. For the intermediary, they are stuck between two opposing and increasingly strict sets of regulations: financial crime and data privacy laws.</p>\n\n<p>Also, centralization makes them vulnerable to cyber attacks.</p>\n\n<p>For the banks, it’s the liability for non-compliance when the intermediary messes up. And there’s another problem: KYC registries are in the business of monetizing your data. And they take power away from their customers: the banks.</p>\n\n<p>Google’s slogan is “don’t be evil”, but their business model is increasingly incompatible with it. At the very least because all governments are incentivized to pressure them into giving them data. In banking, everyone knows Experian is a necessary evil.</p>\n\n<p>We’re offering an alternative.</p>\n\n<p>Tradle’s KYC network allows banks to share data with the help of the blockchain. The blockchain (while not sharing the data), makes the KYC process highly auditable. This makes compliance officers and regulators happy. It also allows Tradle to avoid becoming a data intermediary, and put the customer in the middle; solving data privacy issues.</p>\n\n<p>And this works exactly the same between divisions of the same bank, that today often don’t share KYC data.</p>\n\n<p>Six weeks ago we made a bold statement: three pilots by Demo Day.

Google Apps for mail, calendar, docs, sheets, slides, diagrams. \ni. Everyone's work calendar should be made open to the whole Tradle team. \nii. Google sheets are used until the migration to proper CRM \n1. [Github](https://github.com) for public and private code and docs repositories. \ni. We share private code and docs with customers by asking them to give us their github IDs (which they often do not have - ideas?)\n1. [Travis Ci](https://travis-ci.com/) for automated testing\n1. NPM for publishing software modules so that they can be installed \n1. [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) for deployment of Tradle servers\n1. [Webex](webex.com) for video meetings with customers. It is the only video chat, dial in, and screensharing tool excepted in most all firewalls in banks and other Enterprises. \n1. [Zoom](https://zoom.us) for internal video meetings\n1. Blog: we use Ghost, it is self-hosted and simple (simplistic? - e.g. you must use markdown to write posts, and have to click 'save draft' to avoid losing what you have typed. \n1. [eShares](https://esharesinc.com/) for cap table management\n1. [Gusto for payroll](https://gusto.com/product/payroll)\n\n##Tools we need to choose\n\n###Internal instant communications\nContenders are:\n1. slack (supports mobile & desktop, presence management)\n2. whatsapp (supports SMS, voice, end-to-end encryption developed with Open Whisper Systems)\n\nSlack has taken startup world by storm, it managed to achieve the unachievable - it replaced a lot of email conversations, so it deserves careful consideration.\n\n####Here is my past experience with Slack\nWe used Slack a lot before and although it is extremely well crafted and feature rich, I felt it had significant issues, so before we start using it we need to consider them carefully and institute policies to address them:\n\n1. it is not a web product, is not indexable by Google so does not work for SEO. Note that Ethereum is using [discussion forums](https://vanillaforums.com/) quite well for SEO and support: https://forum.ethereum.org/\n2. it promotes group chat and becomes super super super chatty - I wasted hours and days and felt helpless\ntrying to follow group conversations, especially if were not part of them and are trying to catchup, as on Slack there is no division into threads, just topics, so 5 conversations become intertwined. \ni. The alternative we are considering for long form conversations is https://nodebb.org/ \nii. Simon: Mark has installed NodeBB on http://forum.tradle.io for experimentation, it needs a lot of customization. re:email support, notifications, replacing nodebb branding with ours, figuring out internal forums vs external forums (and the ability to move an existing thread between them)\n1. Slack app on Mac was (is it still?) a major CPU killer, not always, but often. I had to stop it, and then would miss messages.\n1. Slack is costly if you need access to old messages (beyond 10K limit). It is $12 per user.\n\nDoes anyone know remedies or can suggest how to handle above issues?\n\n####Best parts of Slack\n\n1. instant communications - the forum (e.g. NodeBB) is no match, thus we will always relegate to skype chat or messaging\n1. presence - it is very important for a team that is on all continents to know if you can bother someone - as you see them online/away/offline\n1. multitude of integrations with other tools (e.g. you can get notified on slack regarding customer issue, technical problem, etc.)\n \n\n###Support (customer and developer): \n1. instant: slack group\n2. async (delayed response): [NodeBB] forum\n3. tickets/issues: issue tracker provides a lot more structured functionality than the forum. Github issue tracker is quite rudimental and requires understanding which module is at fault, which might be ok for developers but not for customer facing complaints and suggestions. \n\n###Work planning \n1. project/task managers: trello (latest darling of startups using a slightly more visual board style)\n\n###Sales tools\n1. CRM: salesforce (powerful platform but complex, expensive), SuiteCRM (open source, self-hosted), Zoho (10 free licenses). But before choosing the tool, [let's transform the way we sell](http://blog.hubspot.com/sales/inbound-sales-transforming-the-way-you-sell#sm.0001ailorbm9reqju5y1gram9xhd3).\n\n###Event planning\n1. shall we use the CRM for that? It could help with collecting all the leads.\n1. card scanner: today I use CamCard app for scanning business cards, which I get by the dozens. I am told Evernote is miles better, and even connects to LinkedIn, but could not get it to work on my android.\n1. sadly we need to print business cards. Ideally they should have person's photo, and [Tradle] QR code, to connect electronically using Tradle app.\n\n###Newsletter\n1. Ghost blog allows to get connected to a newsletter. TODO.\n2. Many companies use Mailchimp, shall we?\n\n###Marketing\nThis section needs a lot of work, as we have not started our strategic marketing yet\n####Tracking mentions \n1. We need to know when press writes about us and we need to know when to react on social media mentions. Today we  use http://mention.net, should we continue?\n####Posting\n1. we use http://buffer.com to tweet at the preferred time, should be continue?\n#### Journalist relationships\nShall we use CRM for this?\n\n### Funding\nShall we use CRM for managing all engagements?\n      \n###Governance\nLet's explore the possibilities:\n\n1. Buffer is [pushing the envelope](https://buffer.com/transparency) with the radical transparency of their governance. \n1. Corporate actions. We use eShares for cap table management, but it is a glorified excel. We preach to the corporates the corporate actions on blockchain. Time to create them and eat our own dogfood.\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>There is a school of thought on managing growth - you need good managers to manage it, ideally the best managers we can get, right?

As you may already know, we use React Native + magic spells to achieve a Node.js-like environment on iOS and Android. This way the overwhelming majority of our codebase can be reused on all platforms.\n\nIf you read \"overwhelming majority\" carefully, you probably thought to yourself: \"Ha! So there *is* some platform-specific code. I bet that's where the engineers get their gray hair.\" You got me.\n\nCapabilities and APIs differ from environment to environment. Here are some questions we ask ourselves whenever we consider adapting the Tradle app for a new environment:\n\n- Security:\n  - Who has access to this device?\n  - Where do we store private keys? (cross fingers for dedicated secure hardware, e.g. Secure Enclave on iOS)\n  - Where do we store data, and how safe is it there, e.g. can other users/apps access it, can it get wiped by a mis-flick of the wrist?\n  - What cryptography is available? E.g. is there a secure RNG? Will signing/encryption be performant enough or will the app be running at 3 fps?\n- Camera support\n  - Can we take photos of documents here / scan QR codes? If not, can we upload files?\n- Feasibility\n  - How much work will it take to prep the environment? For example, the React Native universe of both core and userland components is much richer on iOS than Android, but Android is catching up quickly.\n- ...plenty more\n\nThe end-result in a perfect world is an as-clean-as-possible separation of environment-specific adaptations from the app itself, a VM so-to-speak for the Tradle app to run in. Then application code doesn't need three toppings of environment checks. Most of the time, the app shouldn't know whether it's running on an iWatch or on neural interface that projects pixels straight into the mind of a dog.\n\nThe browser is not the most secure environment in the world. You can inadvertently wipe out storage, your curious spouse, her private investigator, and your favorite daughter (you know which one's your favorite) often have access to it, you install all kinds of browser extensions and blithely click \"Yes\" under \"I understand that I'm allowing this extension to fill my life with regrets.\" At the same time, its convenience is unmatched. App updates can happen almost invisibly, you're not limited to your thumbs when filling out forms, there's room for more than a button and that ketchup stain on the screen, and the CPU has more horsepower.\n\nSo Tradle in the browser is an experiment. After a week of breathing life into it, the latest checkpoint is end-to-end messaging with a Tradle server, with most of the UI working. But there is still plenty of work to do.\n\nTodo:\n\n- react-native-accordion (fixed today)\n- vector icons (fixed today)\n- react-native-gifted-messenger - fix scroll handler\n- back button / forward button sometimes don't work (need to figure out what generates bad history)\n- chat messages that should show up, don't after back/forward (not related to browser history)\n- password view on login/registration - gesture password is good for touch screens but not a mouse\n- home page loses logo on re-render after splashscreen","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>The project I'm currently working on is getting the Tradle app working in the browser.

Image analysis and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for data extraction\n 2. MRZ zone on passports, visas, and ID cards (see more technical info on MRZ)\n 3. Barcodes (e.g. 2D barcode on the back side of US driving licenses)\n 4. NFC chips on documents\n\nAfter document is scanned, the person could take a selfie, which could then be matched to a photo in the document.\n\nDevice cameras, both rear and front, have greatly improved in recent years, yet scanning with your mobile’s camera present numerous challenges compared to stationary equipment. Inconsistent lighting, reflective surface of the document, angle and contrast of the surface, and the possibility of fraud in this self-service environment need to be addressed. See for example one of the newly emerged techniques, called multi-frame integration.\n\n### Document scanning\nTradle focuses on providers that do fully automatic scanning of documents, as opposed to using teams of people to analyze the documents. Automatic scanning is faster, thus offering a much better user experience, and if server can be installed on-premises, it avoids shipping data oversees, which is great for data locality compliance.\n\nDocument scanning does OCR of data printed on the document, compares it to MRZ, barcode, NFC chip data and detects possible alterations or any other forgery of the document. \n#### We integrated with the following providers\n 1. Onfido - elaborate and very complex API for scanning documents and background checking. Falls back to human teams if software fails to credible scan the documents. API published on their web site. Provides the sandbox for testing, but it returns canned responses, does not process live documents, which makes testing much harder, and demoing impossible.\n 2. Au10tix - just software, no human team. Automatic detection of document type (e.g. passport, driving license). Much simpler API, but it is not public and not documented as well. Provides API keys for testing. Provides real-life document scanning in sandbox. About 5-10 seconds to analyze the document. \n#### Planning to integrate with\nPaycasso. Paycasso is quite advanced, but no public API, no established partnership program with software vendors, so engagement is extremely complicated (had 2 meetings already with the CEO, but still no access to API for testing).\nIDScan - in addition to other capabilities, reads NFC and supposedly checks the hologram. Supposedly the most mature solution on the market, but company policy is direct sales, does not allow software vendors to resell. We are trying to get them to make an exception for us.\n\n### On-device document scanning and data extraction\n\nWhat we have learned is that to achieve high quality of document scanning it is imperative to scan documents on the device. \n\nOn-device software can provide instant feedback for the user with real-time recognition, which means that instead of taking a picture, which is later analyzed on the server, the software is processing a video stream locally and only takes the picture, when it is good enough to extract the data. This is especially important on lower end devices with less sophisticated cameras. On-device scanning helps:\n\n 1. To take picture in focus, with less glare, with better lighting, higher enough contrast to recognize document edges, perspective (not too much tilted), etc.\n 2. To instantly pre-fill online forms with data extracted from the document. This also serves as the indication that document could be recognized.\n 3. Detect that the type of document, avoiding the need to ask the user this question, and to be able to guide the use to scan the back side of the document, by detecting the front side (e.g. US licenses have back tide, but UK do not).\n 4. With preserving privacy, as can support offline mode without server connection\n\nHaving software on the device also allows to read NFC chip on modern documents (this only works on Android Phones at the moment as Apple does not publish an API to the NFC chips in iPhones). \n\nNote: In order to read the data on NFC chip it is necessary to first to read the MRZ zone, the data from which is used to decode the NFC chip’s contents. \n\nNFC chip has customer’s data that is more reliable than could be obtained via optical character recognition (OCR) of the document. In fact it can be cross-checked with the OCR and with the MRZ zone. \n\nNFC chip also contains a high-quality image, which can later be used for face recognition.\n#### We tested the following providers\nProviders below offer mobile apps for testing, which we used to evaluate their solutions.\n\n\n 1. Anyline MRZ - extremely fast MRZ reading. Does not read UK driving licenses, as they do not have MRZ, nor any barcodes.\n 2. BlinkID - reads MRZ reliably, if slowly. Very dependent on lighting conditions, and surface contrast to the document. Limited coverage of driver licenses (US, UK).\n 3. MRZ Recognition by Russian company Smart Engines\n 4. ReadID - scans MRZ and NFC. NFC reading is tricky, UK passports can be read on the cover. US passport needs to be open, scanning can be done only by putting the phone on top of the backside of the page that has a photo.\n\nIssues that need to be addressed\n\n- None of the providers above do automatic document type detection, so a user needs to specify the which document they are scanning\n\n- None of the providers above do automatic detection on whether the document is one sided or two-sided. For example UK driving license is one-sided, and US is two-sided. Same with EU ID Cards, some one, others are two-sided. This means we unfortunately have to ask the user to scan both sides, even when it is not needed.\n- For NFC customer needs instructions on how to scan it, and they depend on the country of passport issue and even possibly the year of issue. \n- NFC reading takes about 10 seconds, so customer needs to be told to hold still, otherwise the reading fails.\n\nBased on the above we need to build a database of all types of documents and give customers instructions on how to do the scanning properly to increase customer conversion.\n#### Face recognition\nFacial recognition has entered the mainstream. Pioneered in mass by Facebook to suggest friend’s faces in photos for tagging, it is now followed by Google and recently by Apple. Microsoft offers several Face APIs for developers, from face matching, detecting faces in images (useful for passports), age and emotion detection. Google is offering similar APIs.\n\nNEC Neoface - supposedly highest quality and performance, but extremely difficult to integrate with at the moment.\nDaon - used by the Mastercard.\nMS Face API - tested by Uber for driver authentication (along with other providers, likely Daon as well, none in production at Uber)\n\n#### Planning to test\n[Facetec](https://facetec.com/ \"target=\"_blank)  \n[Hypr](hypr.com)  \nLiveness detection\nThis is the term used to detect a video/photograph/3D model instead of a live face (face spoofing detection). There are several mechanisms in development, but they have not reached a production level yet.\nLow level components\nThese components can be used to build full document scanning and face matching capabilities:\n\n\nEdge detection and perspective correction\nMRZ zone OCR\nAnother barcode reader\nFace matching using MS Face API (in React native)\nhttp://jmrtd.org/\n\nFace matching to document\nFace matching requires an ability to detect a picture on the image of the document and extract it to enroll the person. Then this picture can be used to match with the selfie taken by the person on their device (mobile or webcam). The problem here is that the photo in the document is usually small (unless extracted from the NFC chip), and has laminate and holograms on top, which cause the glare. Another problem, photo needs to be automatically extracted from the document.\nWe are preparing to test with the following providers\nNeither so far gave us the API key to perform this type of testing. \nOnfido\nAu10tix\nAnd later with those providers\nPaycasso\nMicrosoft Face API (does not extract a photo from the document, need to implement it ourselves)\nGoogle API (same issue as with MS)\n\nNote: One of the important considerations for financial industry whether the provider can work on-premises. Neither Microsoft nor Google provide that option. Given the choices, we will have to explore if we can build our own solution, out of the smaller, focused components.\n\nSanctions and other background checks\nIt is not enough to verify the documents themselves, and that they match a person. Documents can be revoked, and the person may be on sanctions lists (there are a number of lists published by different countries) or a politically exposed person (PEP) who needs special treatment. PEP lists are especially difficult as there is no official lists like with sanctions. And bad press is much harder to automate as it is completely unstructured data.\nWe are planning to test with the following providers\nComplyAdvantage, claims to have 4M PEP records, compared to TR WorldCheck, see below, which has 1.2M records.\nOnfido uses ComplyAdvantage for sanctions and PEP scanning\nOther providers in this area\nThomson Reuters WorldCheck - the staple of sanctions and PEP checking. Only recently added an API.\nKYC3 - a startup that is combining machine reading of news (for bad press) cross-matched with the sanctions lists. Claims to greatly reduce the amount of manual checking that normally needs to be done based on news archives. Has archives for only 3 years, so for prior years resells other archives, like TR and Factiva.\nAccuity. No API, data is provided in the form of CSV files for processing on premises. Has advantage in data locality, but some disadvantage in the need to perform refreshes and build your own searching capabilities. \nFactiva. Provides news articles archives for bad press checking.\n\nAddress verification\n\nAddress verification can be done in several ways:\n\nUnverified customer’s statement, but if customer is aware that they go on record (on blockchain), it has higher value.\nUtility bill (unreliable, 18% fraud rate is cited)\nVerification by the Post Office. The challenge here is how to collect this verification from Post Office electronically, as opposed to just a snapshot of the paper document.\nVerification by Notary (may be Tax advisor can perform this as well?)\nLetter sent by provider to the customer with the number to be entered online. Onfido provides this services, and it is costly ($2.5-3 per letter. if purchased at volume prices). This approach also creates several day delay which may cost the loss of customer.\nElectronic integration with the Gas/Electric/Broadband utility. This approach could give best results. It would be important to find a way to identify utility’s customer, and to collect their consent. It can be achieved by asking customer to log into utility’s web site and scan a QR code.\n\nBusiness registrations\nFor the source of wealth purposes, the Articles of Incorporation and other business documents, like the sale of the business, will need to be verified for authenticity (they also need to be OCR-ed for document searching in the future). \n \nTBD\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><em>Confidential - do not distribute outside of your organization</em></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h3>\n\n<p>A person getting access to financial services needs to pass through the KYC process.

One way to improve it is to share the burden between financial institutions, to achieve KYC portability. To achieve portability we will have to fix many other aspects of KYC. Today KYC portability is limited by several factors:\n\n 1. Collection of KYC is not digitized, thus it is not portable\n - But even if it was digitized, will it be understood if exchanged, as it is not standardized?\n - And if it is standardized, will then jurisdictional and company-specific policies work?\n - And even if it was standardized and thus understood if exchanged, can it be trusted?\n - And even if it was trusted, will exchanging sensitive KYC not violate customers privacy and confidentiality?\n - And if it was privacy preserving, how can regulators be persuaded to allow [controlled] reuse of KYC verifications, as reuse may create a house of cards effect, i.e. one mistake undetected, reused over and over by many.\n\n### Problem analysis\n\n 1. We need to be able to codify what was verified, how it was verified, based on what sources and with what level of confidence. We also need to capture and store all evidentiary documents. \n\n\n - Documents will need their own data models, as passport has different fields from the driver license, and the data collected from the documents must be preserved for future \nanalysis. \n\n\n - Different documents and other objects have very specific aspects that can be verified, i.e. ‘what was being verified’, e.g. the address exists and was verified by visiting it, personal info for presence on sanctions lists. Documents are verified for authenticity, and photo ID documents are verified on their ownership.\n\n - Verifications may have multiple sources. Verified by the in-person examination, verified via digital scanning, verified by calling customer’s number, by visiting the customer’s location, by witnessing customer sign in my presence, etc.\n\n\n - Allow customers to share only some documents and their verifications, but not the others (e.g. driver license, but not the passport).\n\n\n - Allow provider to intelligently query customer for data, minimizing the amount of interactions with the customer. Queries can be arbitrarily complex and reflect the business rules and compliance policies of the provider, yet protect customer’s privacy (see the design document for this). Example:\n\nPlease provide PersonalInfo, as verified based on required documents, e.g. swiss passport, or EU passport, but only if the person was EU born, or lives in the EU for over 10 years, and only if verified by another Tier 1 bank, and only if it was done based on Onfido or Au10tix, and only in the last 2 years (as before that they were very sloppy). Otherwise ask customer to scan the same ID document again.\n\n### Hierarchy of proofs\n\nEvidentiary documents will have their own corresponding forms. Forms like PersonalInfo, which go together with supporting documents, will be sent together with one of those evidentiary document forms, but neither will point to the other (no backlinks/forward links in the object body). Verifications for supporting documents will point to supporting documents. Verifications for PersonalInfo will point to PersonalInfo, but \"sources\" will be verifications for supporting documents.  \n\n    the UI flows:\n    simple:\n      Aviva: 'give us PersonalInfo'\n\n      customer UI:\n        please fill out PersonalInfo or share one of these 10 combinations you already had verified:\n          PersonalInfo as verified by Johnny Cash Company based on Passport\n          PersonalInfo as verified by Led Zeppelin Company based on Driver's License\n          ...\n    slightly more complex:\n      1: customer already has PersonalInfo verified with Passport by Paul McCartney\n        Aviva: 'give us PersonalInfo with Passport or Driver's License\n        customer UI: please fill out PersonalInfo...or share as verified by Paul\n      2: customer only has PersonalInfo with Social Security Card\n        Aviva: 'give us PersonalInfo with Passport or Driver's License\n        customer UI: please fill out PersonalInfo...\n          customer clicks, is asked to scan a Passport or Driver's License\n\njsonQuery(personalInfo.verifications[what = ‘authenticity’] && personalInfo.verifications[how.documentType = ‘passport’]\n\n### Verifications modeling\nVerifications specify what was verified and how it was verified (method). The what is the verifiable aspects: validity, authenticity, etc., and how it was verified.\n\nBecause different documents have different verifiable aspects, the document model needs to list what the verifiable aspects are.

One way to improve it is to share the burden between financial institutions, to achieve KYC portability. To achieve portability we will have to fix many other aspects of KYC. Today KYC portability is limited by several factors:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Collection of KYC is not digitized, thus it is not portable</li>\n<li>But even if it was digitized, will it be understood if exchanged, as it is not standardized?</li>\n<li>And if it is standardized, will then jurisdictional and company-specific policies work?</li>\n<li>And even if it was standardized and thus understood if exchanged, can it be trusted?</li>\n<li>And even if it was trusted, will exchanging sensitive KYC not violate customers privacy and confidentiality?</li>\n<li>And if it was privacy preserving, how can regulators be persuaded to allow [controlled] reuse of KYC verifications, as reuse may create a house of cards effect, i.e. one mistake undetected, reused over and over by many.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"problemanalysis\">Problem analysis</h3>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>We need to be able to codify what was verified, how it was verified, based on what sources and with what level of confidence.

We evangelized and educated the market, presenting at 2-3 conferences a month, meeting with 40 biggest financial institutions in the world, exciting many of the world's governments.\n\nWe persuaded several of the biggest financial institutions to try our approach, and are talking to several most innovative governments to allow us to introduce verifiable identity in their jurisdictions. \n\nIt is a well known fact that Estonia, once a poor tiny post-soviet country, achieved something no other country has done, a deep penetration of digital services across the whole society. No one is signing contracts on paper there anymore, they vote, they make laws, they secure health records, they form companies and do hundreds of other things purely digitally. \n\nYet Estonia could not find a way to help other countries achieve the same, despite making it their key political agenda. Tradle did a 6 months R&D on e-Estonia and has discovered the reason for that. As a result we delivered a prototype for the next generation self-sovereign mobile-first digital identity for Estonia, and got a Letter of Intent from them to work with us to help other countries repeat their success.\n\nWe are now ready to offer this as a platform for all developers, individuals, startups, and those that work in the enterprise, and for the government. \n\nThere are thousands of applications that can be built on the solid digital identity foundation, the foundation that protects our privacy to the highest degree, yet is acceptable by the governments of the world, who are often paranoid about terrorism and financial crime.\n\nMaking blockchain apps is not easy. Making them look good and operate on all platforms, from mobiles to the servers is not easy. \n\nTradle’s platform is not just making it easy, it makes it in style.\n\nAnd it is a marvel of design. It uses one language - JavaScript to run everywhere, on mobiles tablets, web and the servers. We recreated a [subset of] node.js in many environments. Tradle uses the hottest UI framework on earth - React Native. It is open source, and has been from the start. And it is blockchain agnostic. The bitcoin blockchain is still our favorite, but others, like Ethereum, Hyperledger, Corda, have brought new designs and ideas into the red hot distributed ledgers field.

Tradle then is the place to bet on!\n\nIt is time to launch your dream app. Such opportunity, such a technology shift happens only once in a generation.
