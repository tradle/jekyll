#####How do I learn about tradle?
Here isn't a bad place to start. 

#####What is tradle?
A platform which provisions trust between parties where the person or entity wanting to be trusted owns and holds the data

#####What is different about tradle?
We are the only KYC product addressing KYC for all sectors of financial services; banks, insurance, asset managers, brokers and others, fostering synergies between internal product groups with a unified process. KYC utilities only address banks (SWIFT and Accuity) and  corporate clients (Clarient, KYC.com, OrgID, Accuity) 

#####How is this safer than KYC sharing services?
No silos! There's no honey pot for the hackers to attack as the owner is the only one holding the data

#####How are we addressing the portability nightmare?
As the owner holds the data they are free to share it with anyone. Share it with any individual, organisation, agency, government and even across borders.

#####Does this please the regulators?
Absolutely! KYC registries face tougher regulation and business faces massive fines for failure to protect private data.

#####Are we competing with the utilities?
No. Tradle offers a new distribution channel, a network for KYC Utilities to interoperate on, complement each other and to reach a wider global market, with a new low cost automated sales mechanism: customer moves the data and payment is made by recipient bank automatically, with an embedded digital rights management (DRM) mechanism.

#####How does this favour the customer?
No more intermediary for your KYC process. The bank, insurer, supplier or partner has a direct relationship with the customer. 

#####Will it help with corporate compliance?
