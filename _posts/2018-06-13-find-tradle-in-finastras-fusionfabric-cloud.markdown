Our partnership with Finastra has begun! 
The first step was to add Tradle to the [FusionFabric.cloud](https://store.fusionfabric.cloud/" target="_blank) store. The store is a place to try and buy  solutions.

Our CEO, Gene was interviewed by Nathan DiCamillo of the [American Banker](https://www.americanbanker.com/news/finastra-launches-cloud-platform-to-help-banks-link-to-fintechs" target="_blank) for the launch of the store.

The purpose of the store is for banks to find real products, not just the providers.
