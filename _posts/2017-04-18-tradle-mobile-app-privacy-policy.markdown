Tradle’s identity apps enable you to take back ownership of your KYC data you provide to banks, insurers and businesses.

Tradle takes your privacy seriously, and we are committed to maintaining the privacy of the personal information that you provide to us. By using Tradle you acknowledge that the terms and conditions in this Privacy Policy will apply to you, as well as to any information that you give us. Please take the time to read through this Privacy Policy to get acquainted with our practices.

Information you give us when you register an account with the Service (this will include your name, email address, date of birth, address, identity documents, a selfie and other personal information)

We store your information to use for validating your identity. We do not store or use your information for any other purpose. We do not share your information with any other party.

###Cookies 
“Cookies” and locally stored objects, are small data files that we transfer to your computer that collect information such as the pages visited, the date and the time of a visit and other information about your use of the Services. Cookies in and of themselves don’t personally identify you, although they do identify your computer, your accounts, your browser, and your session.

###Accessing or Deleting your Account
You can edit your details at any time by using the app.
If you delete the app it will delete all the data you provided from your device. If you delete the app, you won’t be able to sign in, use the Service, or access any of your information. If you delete the app, we will retain certain information associated with your account, for analytical purposes. 

###Security
Your account and registration information are protected so that only you can access your account on the device you used. All personally identifiable information that we collect about you is stored in limited-access servers. The Service has technical, administrative, and physical security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information which is under our control. While we are committed to implementing reasonable and appropriate safeguards to protect your information against foreseeable risks, no computer system or information can ever be fully protected against any possible risk, and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not be able to circumvent those safeguards, or access and/or use your personal information for improper purposes.

If your device isn’t protected by a pin or other security feature such as touch id the app will not allow you to proceed.

Tradle stores its data in the EEA. This data is subject to EU laws. Thus, your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the EEA and choose to provide information to us, Tradle transfers that information to the EEA and processes it there. By using the Service, you understand and consent that your information may be transferred to our facilities and Aviva UK with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy.

###Changes to our Privacy Policy

When we make changes, we will notify you by making the revised version available on this webpage, and will indicate at the top the date of the latest revision. You should check this Privacy Policy on a regular basis, since revised versions will be binding on you. Any such modifications will be effective when we post the updated Privacy Policy. You understand and agree that your continued access to our Service after any posted modification to the Privacy Policy indicates your acceptance of those modifications.
