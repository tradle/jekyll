We're very proud to announce we made it into the FCA's sandbox!

> Tradle will be participating in a test that we are undertaking as part of the FCA’s Regulatory Sandbox. The regulatory sandbox allows firms to test innovative offerings in a live environment. More information on the FCA’s regulatory sandbox can be found [here](https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/project-innovate-innovation-hub/regulatory-sandbox "target="_blank ).

20 companies have been selected from 69 applicants and we are the only digital identity and KYC business that got in.

We are very pleased to be working with Aviva on an identity pilot in the sandbox where we will onboard live customers. 

Onboarding KYC is very painful for all financially regulated businesses as well as their clients. We aim to speed the process up and reduce the friction caused currently.

We're looking forward to sanding toes and lots of creativity.
