### Digital Identity as a Platform

We will help you create awesome apps at the hackathon!
We have built a digital identity platform on blockchain and have support from many regulators for it.
We can also offer you ideas for the apps to build and we guarantee that you will be able to build and present them at the hackathon.

There are thousands of applications that can be built on the solid digital identity foundation, the foundation that protects our privacy to the highest degree, yet is acceptable by the governments of the world, who are often paranoid about terrorism and financial crime.

We are now ready to offer this as a platform for all developers, individuals, startups, and those that work in the enterprise, and for the government. 

Making blockchain apps is not easy. Making them look good and operate on all platforms, from mobiles to the servers is not easy. 

Tradleâ€™s platform is not just making it easy, it makes it in style.

Tradle is a marvel of design. It uses one language - JavaScript to run everywhere, on mobiles tablets, web and the servers. We recreated a [subset of] node.js in many environments. Tradle uses the hottest UI framework on earth - React Native. It is open source, and has been from the start. And it is blockchain agnostic. The bitcoin blockchain is still our favourite, but others, like Ethereum, Hyperledger, Corda, have brought new designs and ideas into the red hot distributed ledgers field. You want to be future proof? You want your efforts to matter? Tradle then is the place to bet on!
