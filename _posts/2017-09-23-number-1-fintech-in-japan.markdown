The Nihon Keizai Shimbun (Nikkei) and the Financial Services Agency, Fintech Association ran a competition for fintechs in Tokyo. Following a selection process it was a week of workshops and presentations where the final 30 fintechs prepared their final pitches.

This is great recognition for the work we're doing with regulators, banks, insurers and other fintechs in the digital KYC and blockchain space.
