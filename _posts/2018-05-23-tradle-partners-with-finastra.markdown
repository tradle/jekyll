Our [partnership with Finastra](https://www.finastra.com/news-events/press-releases/finastra-adds-us-fintechs-its-open-platform-spur-collaborative"  target="_blank) is an exciting step for us all. FusionFabric.cloud is a leading platform in financial services so it makes perfect sense to plug our award winning KYC on Blockchain solution into the network. 
Finastra serves more than 9000 financial institutions around the world and our goal is to provide their customers with our class leading KYC solution.
Tradle's KYC solution draws on the full benefits of the cloud while giving the institution full control of the data in a Private SaaS model; we call it MyCloud.
